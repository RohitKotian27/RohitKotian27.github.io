It is a simple philosophy.","Only one thing is ever guaranteed, that is that you will definitely not achieve the goal if you don't take the shot.","The fact is that grief today is a family matter as much as it is an individual one.","Reading without reflecting is like eating without digesting.","If you wish to know what a man is, place him in authority.","If you can find a path with no obstacles, it probably doesn't lead anywhere.","As you know, madness is like gravity…all it takes is a little push.","Don’t let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.","Successful and unsuccessful people do not vary greatly in their abilities. They vary in their desires to reach their potential.","Strive for progress, not perfection.","There are no shortcuts to any place worth going.","Failure is the opportunity to begin again more intelligently.","Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.","You’ve got to get up every morning with determination if you’re going to go to bed with satisfaction."];
